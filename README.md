Exercise Workout Pose Detection and Correction
This repository contains Python-based code for detecting and correcting exercise workout poses using OpenCV and MediaPipe, cutting-edge tools for computer vision and machine learning pipelines.
The project utilizes MediaPipe's holistic pose estimation capabilities to track human body movements in real time. By analyzing joint positions and angles, the system determines the correctness of workout poses, providing instant feedback to improve posture and technique.
